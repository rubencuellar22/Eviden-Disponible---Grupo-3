    <section id="explainmethod"getIdSkTechSkill>
        <h2>Explain Method - getIdSkTechSkill</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet represents a method called `getIdSkTechSkill()` which returns an integer value. The method does not take any parameters.<br><br>The purpose of this method is to retrieve the `idSkTechSkill` value. It is likely a getter method for a variable or field named `idSkTechSkill` in a class or object. The `idSkTechSkill` variable is of type int, which means it can hold integer values.<br><br>By calling this method, the value of `idSkTechSkill` can be obtained, allowing other parts of the code to access and work with this value as needed.<br><br>This method is a simple implementation of a getter, which is a common practice in object-oriented programming to provide controlled access to private variables or fields.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setIdSkTechSkill>
        <h2>Explain Method - setIdSkTechSkill</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a setter method for the `idSkTechSkill` variable. It takes an integer parameter `idSkTechSkill` and assigns its value to the `idSkTechSkill` variable of the current object.<br><br>Setter methods are commonly used in object-oriented programming to set the values of private variables of a class. By using setters, we can control the access to variables and enforce any necessary validation or logic before assigning a value.<br><br>In this specific case, the `setIdSkTechSkill` method allows us to set the value of the `idSkTechSkill` variable for an instance of a class. The method does not return any value, it simply updates the `idSkTechSkill` variable with the provided value.<br><br>This code snippet is a small part of a larger class or system where the `idSkTechSkill` variable is used and manipulated.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"getSkTechSkill>
        <h2>Explain Method - getSkTechSkill</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet defines a method called `getSkTechSkill` that returns a `String` value. The method does not take any parameters. <br><br>The method is used to retrieve the value of a private variable called `skTechSkill`. It is assumed that this variable is declared and initialized elsewhere in the code. <br><br>The purpose of this method is to encapsulate the access to the `skTechSkill` variable, providing a way to retrieve its value without directly accessing the variable itself. This promotes encapsulation and information hiding, as the internal implementation details of the variable are hidden from other parts of the code. <br><br>By using this method, other parts of the code can get the value of `skTechSkill` by calling this method instead of directly accessing the variable, which can help maintain code organization and flexibility.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getNivel>
        <h2>Explain Method - getNivel</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a method named `getNivel` which belongs to a class. The method returns an integer value.<br><br>The purpose of this method is to retrieve the value of a private variable `nivel`. The `nivel` variable is a member of the class and is accessed using the `this` keyword, which refers to the current instance of the class.<br><br>By calling this `getNivel` method, other parts of the program can obtain the value of the `nivel` variable without directly accessing it. This follows the principle of encapsulation, where the internal implementation details of a class are hidden and accessed through public methods.<br><br>The returned value can be used for various purposes in the program, such as displaying the current level of an object or performing calculations based on the level value.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setNivel>
        <h2>Explain Method - setNivel</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:** <br>This code is a method called `setNivel` that is used to set the value of the `nivel` variable. The `nivel` variable is an integer that represents a level. The method takes an integer parameter called `nivel` and assigns its value to the `this.nivel` variable.<br><br>The purpose of this method is to allow external code to set the value of the `nivel` variable. By providing a public setter method, other parts of the program can modify the value of `nivel` without directly accessing the variable itself. This encapsulation helps to maintain the integrity of the `nivel` variable and ensures that any necessary validation or logic can be applied when setting its value.<br><br>To use this method, simply call it with an integer parameter representing the desired level. For example, `setNivel(3)` would set the `nivel` variable to 3.</p>

        <h2>Explain Method - getEmpleado</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br>This code snippet defines a method called `getEmpleado` that returns an object of type `Empleado`. <br><br>The method is a member of a class, and the `this` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class. <br><br>The `Empleado` object that is returned by the method represents an employee. <br><br>The purpose of this method is to provide access to the `Empleado` object, allowing other parts of the code to retrieve information about the employee or perform operations on the employee object. <br><br>By returning the `Empleado` object, other parts of the code can call this method to retrieve the employee object and use it as needed.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setEmpleado>
        <h2>Explain Method - setEmpleado</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a setter method that sets the value of the "empleado" variable in the current class. The method takes an instance of the "Empleado" class as a parameter and assigns it to the "empleado" variable.<br><br>The "Empleado" class is likely a custom class that represents an employee, and the "empleado" variable is an instance of this class. By setting the "empleado" variable with this method, we can update the employee information stored in the current class.<br><br>This setter method is useful when we want to update the "empleado" variable from outside the class. It ensures that the value of the "empleado" variable is properly updated and encapsulates the logic of updating the variable within the class.<br><br>Overall, this code provides a way to update the employee information stored in the current class by setting the "empleado" variable.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"toString>
        <h2>Explain Method - toString</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>The code snippet provided is an implementation of the `toString()` method in a class called `SkTechSkill`. The `toString()` method is an overridden method from the `Object` class, which is the base class for all Java objects. <br><br>The `toString()` method is used to return a string representation of the object. In this case, the method returns a string that contains the values of the instance variables of the `SkTechSkill` class. <br><br>The returned string is constructed by concatenating various strings and the values of the instance variables using the `+` operator. The `+` operator is used to concatenate strings in Java. <br><br>The `toString()` method is commonly used for debugging and logging purposes as it provides a human-readable representation of the object's state. It is also used implicitly when an object is passed to methods like `System.out.println()` or when it is concatenated with a string using the `+` operator.</p>

        <h2> Review </h2>
        <p>**Code Review summary** - The code looks generally well-written and follows standard Java conventions. However, there are a few areas that could be improved. <br><br>1. The class name "SkTechSkill" does not follow standard Java naming conventions. It should be named "TechSkill" instead.<br><br>2. The "empleado" field is not properly annotated with the @ManyToOne annotation. It should be annotated with @ManyToOne(targetEntity = Empleado.class) to specify the target entity.<br><br>3. The "nivel" field is not properly annotated with the @Column annotation. It should be annotated with @Column(name = "nivel") to specify the column name.<br><br>4. The toString() method could be improved by using String.format() instead of concatenation.<br><br>Overall, the code quality is good, but these improvements would enhance readability and maintainability. I would rate the code quality as 8 out of 10.</p>
