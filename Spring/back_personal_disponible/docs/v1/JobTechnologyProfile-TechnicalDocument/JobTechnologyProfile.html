    <section id="explainmethod"getNivel>
        <h2>Explain Method - getNivel</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a method called `getNivel` which is part of a class. The method returns an integer value representing the "nivel" (level) of an object. <br><br>The `getNivel` method does not take any parameters and simply returns the value of the "nivel" instance variable of the object. The "nivel" instance variable is likely defined elsewhere in the class.<br><br>This method is useful when you need to access the "nivel" value of an object from outside the class. By using this method, you can retrieve the value without directly accessing the instance variable itself.<br><br>Using this method also encapsulates the "nivel" variable, making it private and only accessible through this getter method. This provides a level of abstraction and prevents direct modification of the "nivel" value from outside the class, ensuring data integrity and encapsulation.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setNivel>
        <h2>Explain Method - setNivel</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a setter method that sets the value of the variable "nivel". The method takes an integer parameter called "nivel" and assigns its value to the variable "nivel" of the current object. The "this" keyword is used to refer to the current object. <br><br>This code is part of a class and is commonly used in object-oriented programming to encapsulate the access to the class's variables. By providing a setter method, other parts of the program can set the value of the "nivel" variable without directly accessing it. This helps to maintain encapsulation and allows for better control over the variable's value.<br><br>In terms of documentation, this code can be described as a setter method that sets the value of the "nivel" variable. It is important to note that this code assumes the existence of a class and the declaration of the "nivel" variable.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getEmpleado>
        <h2>Explain Method - getEmpleado</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a method called "getEmpleado" that belongs to a class. The method returns an object of type "Empleado", which is the class's member variable named "empleado".<br><br>The purpose of this method is to provide access to the "empleado" member variable from outside the class. By returning the "empleado" object, other parts of the code can retrieve information or perform operations on it.<br><br>This method is a getter method, also known as an accessor method, as it follows the naming convention of "get" followed by the variable name. Getter methods are commonly used to retrieve the value of a private member variable in object-oriented programming and are typically used in conjunction with setter methods to provide controlled access to the class's data.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setEmpleado>
        <h2>Explain Method - setEmpleado</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a method called `setEmpleado` that sets the value of a variable `empleado` in the current object. The `Empleado` class is a user-defined class that represents an employee.<br><br>The method takes an argument of type `Empleado` called `empleado` and assigns its value to the `empleado` variable in the current object.<br><br>This method is useful when we want to update the value of the `empleado` variable in an object of this class. It allows us to encapsulate the logic for setting the value of the variable and ensures that any necessary validation or processing is done before assigning the value.<br><br>To use this method, we can create an instance of the `Empleado` class and call the `setEmpleado` method on an object of another class that has a reference to the `Empleado` object. This will update the value of the `empleado` variable in that object.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"toString>
        <h2>Explain Method - toString</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is an implementation of the `toString()` method for the `JobTechnologyProfile` class. The `toString()` method is used to convert an object into a string representation.<br><br>In this code, the method returns a string that contains the values of the `idJobTechnologyProfile`, `empleado`, `jobTechnologyProfile`, and `nivel` variables. The string is formatted in a specific way using concatenation and escape sequences.<br><br>The `idJobTechnologyProfile`, `empleado`, `jobTechnologyProfile`, and `nivel` variables are all part of the `JobTechnologyProfile` class and hold different properties of a job technology profile.<br><br>This `toString()` method is useful for debugging and logging purposes as it provides a human-readable representation of the `JobTechnologyProfile` object. It can be called explicitly or implicitly when the object is used in a context that requires a string representation, such as printing or logging.</p>

        <h2> Review </h2>
        <p>**Code Review summary** - The code follows the standard Java coding conventions and is well-structured. However, there are a few areas for improvement. <br><br>1. The naming of the variables and methods could be more descriptive. Consider using meaningful names that accurately represent their purpose.<br>2. The code could benefit from adding comments to explain the purpose and functionality of certain sections.<br>3. There is a potential issue with the CascadeType.ALL in the @ManyToOne annotation. This could lead to unintended cascading operations when updating or deleting entities.<br>4. Consider adding validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected errors.<br><br>Overall, the code shows good structure and adherence to coding conventions. With some improvements in naming, commenting, and error handling, the code will be even better. <br><br>Code quality assessment: 7/10</p>
