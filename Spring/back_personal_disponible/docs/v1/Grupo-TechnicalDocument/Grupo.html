 <h3>Explanation -</h3>
 <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>The `Grupo` class is a model class that represents a group entity in the system. It is annotated with `@Entity` to indicate that it is a persistent entity and `@NamedQuery` to define a named query for retrieving all groups.<br><br>The class has the following attributes:<br>- `id_grupo`: A unique identifier for the group.<br>- `grupos`: The name of the group.<br>- `cc`: A field representing some value (possibly related to the group).<br>- `grupo1`, `grupo2`, `grupo3`, `grupo4`: Four additional fields representing some values (possibly related to the group).<br><br>The class also has a one-to-many association with the `Empleado` class, meaning that a group can have multiple employees. This association is represented by the `empleados` attribute, which is a list of employees associated with the group.<br><br>The class provides getter and setter methods for all attributes, as well as methods to add and remove employees from the group.<br><br>Additionally, the class overrides the `toString()` method to provide a string representation of the group object.<br><br>Overall, the `Grupo` class represents a group entity and provides methods to manage its attributes and associated employees.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getGrupos>
        <h2>Explain Method - getGrupos</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a getter method for a variable called "grupos". The method is defined with a return type of String. <br><br>The purpose of this method is to retrieve the value of the "grupos" variable. The method does not take any arguments.<br><br>The "grupos" variable is assumed to be a class-level variable or an instance variable, as it is accessed using the "this" keyword. <br><br>By calling this method, the value of the "grupos" variable will be returned as a String. The method does not modify the value of the variable or perform any additional operations.<br><br>This getter method can be used to access and retrieve the value of the "grupos" variable from other parts of the code, providing encapsulation and controlled access to the variable.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setGrupos>
        <h2>Explain Method - setGrupos</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This is a method in a class that sets the value of a variable named "grupos". The method takes a parameter of type String, which represents the new value for the variable. <br><br>The keyword "this" is used to refer to the current object, and the variable "grupos" on the left side of the assignment operator (=) is the instance variable of the current object. <br><br>By assigning the value of the parameter to the instance variable, this method updates the value of the "grupos" variable with the new value passed as an argument. <br><br>This method does not return any value (void), it simply updates the value of the "grupos" variable.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getCc>
        <h2>Explain Method - getCc</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This is a getter method for the "cc" attribute of the class. The method returns a String value. <br><br>The "cc" attribute is a private variable of the class, and this getter method allows other parts of the code to access its value. The keyword "this" is used to refer to the current instance of the class, ensuring that the correct "cc" attribute is returned. <br><br>By providing a getter method, the class encapsulates the implementation details of the "cc" attribute and provides a controlled way for other parts of the code to retrieve its value. This can be useful for maintaining data integrity and enforcing security or validation checks.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setCc>
        <h2>Explain Method - setCc</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a setter method for the "cc" attribute of a class. The method takes a string parameter "cc" and assigns it to the class attribute "cc" using the "this" keyword. The "this" keyword refers to the current instance of the class.<br><br>In object-oriented programming, setter methods are used to set the values of private attributes of a class. By using a setter method, we can encapsulate the attribute and control how it is set.<br><br>In this code, the setter method allows us to set the value of the "cc" attribute from outside the class. This promotes encapsulation and data hiding, as the attribute is not directly accessible outside the class.<br><br>Overall, this code provides a way to set the value of the "cc" attribute of a class using a setter method.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getGrupo1>
        <h2>Explain Method - getGrupo1</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a method named `getGrupo1()` that returns a String value. The method is a part of a class that has a variable called `grupo1`. This method is used to retrieve the value of `grupo1` from an instance of the class.<br><br>The method is defined with the public access modifier, which means it can be accessed from anywhere in the codebase. It does not take any parameters.<br><br>The method simply returns the value of the `grupo1` variable using the `return` keyword. The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.<br><br>By calling this method on an instance of the class, the value of `grupo1` can be obtained. This method can be useful in scenarios where external code needs to access or retrieve the value of `grupo1` from an instance of the class.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"setGrupo1>
        <h2>Explain Method - setGrupo1</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a method called `setGrupo1` that takes a parameter of type `String` named `grupo1`. It is a public method, which means it can be accessed from outside of the class. <br><br>Inside the method, it assigns the value of the `grupo1` parameter to the instance variable `this.grupo1`. The `this` keyword refers to the current object instance, allowing us to access the instance variable.<br><br>The purpose of this method is to set the value of the `grupo1` variable. It is commonly used in object-oriented programming for encapsulation and data abstraction. By providing a public setter method, other classes can modify the value of `grupo1` without directly accessing the variable, which helps maintain encapsulation and control over the variable's value.<br><br>This method does not return any value, as it only modifies the value of the `grupo1` instance variable.</p>

    <section id="review-comment">
        <h2> Review </h2>
        <p>**Code Review Summary** - The code looks generally good with some minor improvements that can be made. The class `Grupo` represents a persistent entity and contains fields, getters, setters, and associations with other entities. The code follows the Java naming conventions and is well-organized. However, there are a few areas that can be improved. The naming of variables and methods can be more descriptive. The code lacks proper documentation and comments. It would be beneficial to add more information about the purpose and usage of the class and its members. Overall, the code quality is satisfactory, but there is room for improvement.<br><br>Code Quality Assessment: 7/10</p>
