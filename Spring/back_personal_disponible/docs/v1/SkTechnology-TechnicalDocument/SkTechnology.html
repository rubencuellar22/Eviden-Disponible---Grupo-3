    <section id="explainmethod"setSktechnology>
        <h2>Explain Method - setSktechnology</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet defines a public method called `setSktechnology` that takes a parameter `sktechnology` of type `String`. <br><br>The purpose of this method is to set the value of the `sktechnology` variable, which is a member variable of the class. The keyword `this` is used to refer to the current instance of the class.<br><br>By calling this method and passing a `String` value, the value of `sktechnology` is updated with the new value passed as the parameter.<br><br>This method does not return any value (`void`), and its access modifier is set to public, meaning it can be accessed from outside the class.<br><br>This method can be used to update the value of the `sktechnology` variable, allowing for dynamic changes to this specific property of an object of the class.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getNivel>
        <h2>Explain Method - getNivel</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code defines a method called `getNivel()` which returns an integer value representing the `nivel` of an object. The `nivel` is an attribute of the class or object that this method belongs to.<br><br>The `getNivel()` method does not take any parameters and simply returns the value of `nivel` using the `this` keyword to refer to the current instance of the object. The `this` keyword is used to differentiate between the class attribute `nivel` and any local variables that may have the same name.<br><br>This method can be useful when we want to access the value of the `nivel` attribute from outside the class or object. It provides encapsulation and allows us to control the access and modification of the `nivel` attribute by providing only a getter method.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setNivel>
        <h2>Explain Method - setNivel</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet represents a setter method for the "nivel" variable. The "nivel" variable is an integer that represents the level of something. The purpose of this method is to set the value of the "nivel" variable with the provided input value.<br><br>The method takes an integer parameter called "nivel" and assigns it to the instance variable with the same name using the "this" keyword. The "this" keyword refers to the current instance of the class.<br><br>This method does not return any value, as it is a void method. It simply updates the value of the "nivel" variable to the provided input value.<br><br>This setter method can be used to update or modify the value of the "nivel" variable from outside the class. It provides a way to encapsulate the variable and control its access and modification.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"toString>
        <h2>Explain Method - toString</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>The `toString()` method is an overridden method in Java that is used to convert an object into a string representation. In this code snippet, the `toString()` method is overridden for the `SkTechnology` class.<br><br>The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the `SkTechnology` object, which includes the values of its instance variables. The returned string is constructed by concatenating various strings and variables using the `+` operator.<br><br>The returned string has the following format:<br>"SkTechnology{idSkTechnology=<idSkTechnology>, empleado=<empleado>, sktechnology='<sktechnology>', nivel=<nivel>}"<br><br>Here, `<idSkTechnology>`, `<empleado>`, `<sktechnology>`, and `<nivel>` are placeholders for the actual values of the corresponding instance variables.<br><br>This overridden `toString()` method can be useful for debugging purposes or when we need to convert a `SkTechnology` object into a string representation for display or logging.</p>

        <h2> Review </h2>
        <p>**Code Review Summary** - The code snippet appears to be a model class for a technology entity. <br><br>Strengths:<br>- The code follows the Java naming conventions.<br>- The annotations for JPA are correctly used.<br>- The code includes the necessary getters and setters.<br><br>Recommendations:<br>- The class name "SkTechnology" should follow the standard Java naming convention of using camel case, such as "SkTechnology".<br>- The table name in the @Table annotation should match the actual table name in the database, which seems to be "tecnologias" based on the comments.<br>- The code could benefit from adding more comments to explain the purpose of each attribute and method.<br>- The "@NamedQuery" annotation is not necessary unless there is a specific named query to be defined.<br><br>Overall, the code quality is good, but there are some minor improvements that can be made. I would rate the code quality as 7 out of 10.</p>
