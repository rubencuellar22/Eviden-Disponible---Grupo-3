    <section id="explainmethod"stepDelete>
        <h2>Explain Method - stepDelete</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code defines a method called `stepDelete` which returns a Step object. The Step object is created using the StepBuilder class, with the name "stepDelete" and the jobRepository as parameters. The Step is configured to use a tasklet called `itemDeleteStep()` and a transactionManager.<br><br>A Step represents a single task or a phase within a larger job. In this case, the step is named "stepDelete" and it is responsible for deleting items.<br><br>The tasklet is a single-threaded, non-repeatable step that performs a specific task. In this code, `itemDeleteStep()` is the tasklet that will be executed when the step is run.<br><br>The transactionManager is responsible for managing transactions within the step. It ensures that the step's operations are executed in a consistent and reliable manner.<br><br>Overall, this code defines a step called "stepDelete" that performs item deletion as a task using a tasklet and a transaction manager.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"allInOneStep>
        <h2>Explain Method - allInOneStep</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>The given code is a configuration for creating a Spring bean named "stepAllInOne". The bean is of type AllInOneTasklet, which is a custom Tasklet implementation. The method allInOneStep() returns an instance of the AllInOneTasklet class.<br><br>The AllInOneTasklet class is responsible for defining the logic that needs to be executed in a single step. It is a Tasklet, which means it has two methods: execute() and rollback(). The execute() method contains the main logic that needs to be executed, while the rollback() method is used to handle any exceptions or errors that occur during the execution.<br><br>By creating a Spring bean for the AllInOneTasklet class, it can be easily injected into other components or steps in a Spring Batch job. This allows for better modularity and reusability of the code.<br><br>Overall, this code snippet is creating a Spring bean for a custom Tasklet implementation, which can be used in a Spring Batch job to execute a specific logic in a single step.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"stepAIO>
        <h2>Explain Method - stepAIO</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet defines a bean named "AIO" which represents a step in a job. The step is created using the StepBuilder class and is given a name "stepAllInOne". The step is associated with a job repository and a transaction manager.<br><br>The step is defined as a tasklet, which means it will execute a single task within a transaction. The task to be executed is specified by the allInOneStep() method.<br><br>The StepBuilder is used to configure the step by providing the tasklet and transaction manager. The build() method is called to create and return the Step object.<br><br>This code can be used in a Spring Batch application to define a step that performs a specific task within a job. The step can be executed as part of a larger job, and the transaction management ensures that the task is executed atomically and consistently.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"excelToCsvTasklet>
        <h2>Explain Method - excelToCsvTasklet</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a Spring Bean configuration method that creates and returns an instance of the `ExcelToCsvTasklet` class. The `ExcelToCsvTasklet` is a custom tasklet used for converting Excel files to CSV files.<br><br>The `@Bean` annotation is used to indicate that the method should be used to create and configure a bean in the Spring ApplicationContext. <br><br>The `ExcelToCsvTasklet` class itself is responsible for performing the Excel to CSV conversion. It likely contains logic to read an Excel file, extract the data, and write it to a CSV file.<br><br>By declaring this method as a bean, it can be easily injected into other components or used in Spring Batch job configurations. This allows for easy reusability and modularity of the Excel to CSV conversion logic within the Spring application.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"excelToCsvStep>
        <h2>Explain Method - excelToCsvStep</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a method that creates and configures a step in a batch job for converting an Excel file to a CSV file. The method is annotated with `@Bean` to indicate that it should be managed by the Spring framework.<br><br>The `Step` object is created using the `StepBuilder` class, which takes two parameters: the name of the step ("excelToCsvStep") and the job repository. The step is configured as a tasklet step, which means it will execute a single tasklet.<br><br>The tasklet for the step is provided by the `excelToCsvTasklet()` method. The tasklet is responsible for the actual conversion from Excel to CSV. The `transactionManager` is also passed to the step builder, which allows for transaction management during the execution of the step.<br><br>Once the step is built, it is returned by the method and can be added to a job configuration to define the flow of the batch job.</p>
