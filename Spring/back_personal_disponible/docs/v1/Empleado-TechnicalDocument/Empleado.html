        <h2>Explain Method - addSkTechSkill</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code defines a method called `addSkTechSkill`, which takes an object of type `SkTechSkill` as a parameter. The method is used to add the `skTechSkill` object to a list called `skTechSkills`. <br><br>This method does not return any value (void). It simply adds the `skTechSkill` object to the `skTechSkills` list.<br><br>This code can be part of a larger class that represents a person or an employee, where `skTechSkills` is a list of technical skills possessed by the person. By calling this method, a new technical skill can be added to the person's list of skills.<br><br>It is important to note that the `skTechSkills` list should be initialized before calling this method, otherwise an error may occur. Additionally, this code assumes that the `SkTechSkill` class has been properly defined with the necessary attributes and methods.</p>

        <h2>Explain Method - toString</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:** <br><br>This code snippet overrides the `toString()` method of a class. The `toString()` method is a built-in method in Java that is used to convert an object to a string representation. By default, the `toString()` method returns a string representation of the object's memory address.<br><br>In this code, the `toString()` method is overridden to provide a custom string representation of an "Empleado" (employee) object. The returned string contains various properties of the employee object, such as "gin" (employee identification number), "name", "subgroup", "status", "bench" (whether the employee is on the bench or not), "das" (Direct Assignment Statement), "ciudad" (city), "agrupacion" (grouping), "lineManager" (line manager's name), "jornada" (working hours), "gcm" (Global Capability Manager), "categoria" (category), "nivelgcm" (GCM level), "scr" (Scrum), "grupo" (group), "n4" (N4 level), "jobTechnology" (job technology), "jobTechnologyProfiles" (profiles associated with job technology), "skills" (employee's skills), "role" (employee's role), "rlt" (Resource Link Team), and various skill-related properties.<br><br>The custom string representation is constructed using concatenation of property names and values in a formatted manner.

        <h2> Review </h2>
        <p>**Code Review Summary** - The code appears to be well-structured and follows naming conventions. The use of annotations for mapping the entity and relationships is appropriate. However, there are a few areas that can be improved:<br><br>1. Naming conventions: Some variable names are not descriptive enough, such as "gin" and "n4". Consider using more meaningful names to improve code readability.<br>2. Inconsistent use of data types: The "nivelgcm" field is defined as an int while other similar fields are defined as Double. Ensure consistency in data types.<br>3. Unused imports: There are some unused import statements that should be removed to keep the code clean.<br>4. Lack of validation and error handling: The code does not have any input validation or error handling mechanisms. Consider adding appropriate checks and exception handling to handle unexpected scenarios.<br>5. Code duplication: There is some duplication in the methods for adding and removing items from the various lists. Consider refactoring these methods to avoid repetitive code.<br><br>Overall, the code quality is good, but there are areas for improvement. I would rate the code quality as 7 out of 10.</p>
