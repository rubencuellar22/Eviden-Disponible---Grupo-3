 <h3>Explanation -</h3>
 <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code defines a Java class called `SkLenguage` which represents a database table called "SkLenguage". The class is annotated with `@Entity` and `@Table` annotations to indicate that it is a JPA entity and to specify the name of the database table. <br><br>The class has several private fields which represent the columns of the table. These fields are annotated with `@Column` to specify the name of the corresponding database column. There is also an `@Id` annotation on the `idSklenguage` field to specify that it is the primary key of the table. <br><br>The class has getter and setter methods for each field, allowing other classes to access and modify the data. <br><br>There is also a `toString()` method that returns a string representation of the object, which includes the values of all the fields. <br><br>Overall, this class represents a database table and provides methods for accessing and modifying the data in that table.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getNivel>
        <h2>Explain Method - getNivel</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a method named `getNivel` that belongs to a class. The method returns a string value which represents the current value of the variable `nivel`. This method does not take any input parameters.<br><br>The purpose of this method is to retrieve the value of the `nivel` variable. The `nivel` variable is likely a property or attribute of the class, and the `getNivel` method allows other parts of the code to access this value.<br><br>By calling this method, other parts of the code can obtain the current value of the `nivel` variable without directly accessing it. This can be useful for encapsulation and abstraction purposes, as it provides a controlled way to access the value and potentially perform additional logic or validation before returning it.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setNivel>
        <h2>Explain Method - setNivel</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is part of a class and defines a method named `setNivel`. The method takes a parameter `nivel` of type `String`. <br><br>The purpose of this method is to set the value of the instance variable `nivel` to the value provided as the parameter. The instance variable `nivel` is likely declared in the class where this method is defined.<br><br>By using the `this` keyword, the code ensures that the value provided as the parameter is assigned to the correct instance variable `nivel` of the object on which the method is called.<br><br>This method does not return any value and is likely used to update the value of the `nivel` variable in an object of the class. It can be called by other parts of the code to set the value of `nivel` to a specific string.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getEmpleado>
        <h2>Explain Method - getEmpleado</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a method named `getEmpleado` that returns an `Empleado` object. The `Empleado` class is not defined in this code, but it can be assumed that it is a class representing an employee with various properties and methods.<br><br>The method simply returns the `empleado` object, which is a member variable of the current class (or possibly a parameter passed to the method). This means that the method is used to retrieve the `Empleado` object stored in the `empleado` variable.<br><br>The purpose of this method may be to provide access to the `Empleado` object for other parts of the code that need to retrieve or manipulate employee data. By encapsulating the `empleado` object within a getter method, it ensures that the object can only be accessed through the method, providing a level of control and abstraction.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setEmpleado>
        <h2>Explain Method - setEmpleado</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br>This code snippet defines a public method called `setEmpleado` which takes an `Empleado` object as a parameter. The `Empleado` class is likely a custom class representing an employee. <br><br>The purpose of this method is to set the value of the `empleado` instance variable of the current object. The `this` keyword refers to the current object, and the `empleado` variable is assigned the value of the `empleado` parameter passed to the method.<br><br>In other words, this method allows the caller to set the value of the `empleado` instance variable of an object of this class. This can be useful when updating or initializing the employee data associated with this object.<br><br>It is important to note that this method does not return any value (`void`), and it assumes that the `Empleado` class has been properly defined with appropriate getters and setters for its properties.</p>

        <h2>Explain Method - toString</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet overrides the toString() method of a class named SkLenguage. The toString() method is a built-in method in Java that is used to convert an object into a human-readable string.<br><br>The overridden toString() method returns a string representation of the SkLenguage object. It concatenates the values of the object's properties, such as idSklenguage, empleado, sklenguage, and nivel, with descriptive labels. The properties are enclosed within curly braces and separated by commas.<br><br>The purpose of overriding the toString() method is to provide a customized and meaningful string representation of the SkLenguage object. This can be useful for debugging, logging, or displaying the object's information to users.<br><br>By providing a clear and concise string representation, it enhances the readability and understandability of the SkLenguage object when it is converted to a string using the toString() method.</p>
