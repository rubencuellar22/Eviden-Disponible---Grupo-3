        <h2> Review </h2>
        <p>## Code Review Summary<br><br>The code provided is the implementation of the `EmpleadoService` interface. The code contains multiple issues and areas for improvement. <br><br>1. **Inconsistent Naming**: The naming conventions used in the code are inconsistent. Some variables and methods use camel case, while others use snake case. It is recommended to follow a consistent naming convention throughout the code.<br><br>2. **Unused Imports**: There are several unused import statements in the code. It is recommended to remove these unused imports to improve code readability and maintainability.<br><br>3. **Code Duplication**: There is a significant amount of code duplication in the `createEmpleado` method. The code for creating different entities (`JobTechnologyProfile`, `SkLenguage`, etc.) follows a similar pattern. It is recommended to refactor this code to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.<br><br>4. **Assertions**: There are several assertions in the code that are not necessary and can be removed. Assertions should only be used for debugging purposes and should not be relied upon for normal program execution.<br><br>5. **Error Handling**: The code does not handle any exceptions that may occur during database operations. It is recommended to add appropriate error handling and exception handling mechanisms to provide better feedback to the user and prevent unexpected crashes.<br><br>6. **Code Formatting**: The code is not properly formatted, making it difficult to read and understand. It is recommended to use consistent indentation and formatting to improve code readability.<br><br>Overall, the code quality is low due to the issues mentioned above. The code needs significant improvements in terms of naming conventions, code duplication, error handling, and formatting. <br><br>Code Quality Assessment: 4/10</p>
