 <h3>Explanation -</h3>
 <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code defines a model class called `SkCertif` which represents a certification for an employee. It is annotated with `@Entity` to indicate that it is a persistent entity and `@Table` to specify the name of the database table.<br><br>The class has several private fields such as `idSkCertif`, `empleado`, `skcertif`, and `external` which represent the unique ID of the certification, the employee associated with the certification, the name of the certification, and whether the certification is external or not.<br><br>The class also has getters and setters for these fields to provide access to their values. The `toString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `SkCertif` object.<br><br>The code also includes annotations such as `@Id`, `@Column`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@ManyToOne`, and `@JoinColumn` which define the mapping between the database table and the fields of the `SkCertif` class.<br><br>Overall, this code defines a model class for a certification with its associated properties and mappings for persistence.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getIdSkCertif>
        <h2>Explain Method - getIdSkCertif</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet represents a method called `getIdSkCertif` that returns an integer value. <br><br>The method does not take any input parameters and simply returns the value of the `idSkCertif` variable. <br><br>The `idSkCertif` variable is presumably a data member or property that holds the identification number for a certification. <br><br>This method is useful when we want to retrieve the identification number of a certification object in a program. It can be called from other parts of the code to access and use the certification's identification number. <br><br>By encapsulating the `idSkCertif` variable access within this method, we ensure that the value is retrieved consistently and in a controlled manner, adhering to the principles of encapsulation and information hiding.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"setIdSkCertif>
        <h2>Explain Method - setIdSkCertif</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a setter method for the "idSkCertif" variable. It takes an integer value as a parameter and assigns it to the "idSkCertif" variable of the class. The "this" keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class. <br><br>Setter methods are commonly used in object-oriented programming to set the values of private variables. By encapsulating the variables and providing setter methods, we can control the access and modification of these variables. In this case, the "setIdSkCertif" method allows us to set the value of the "idSkCertif" variable from outside the class.<br><br>This method does not return any value, as its purpose is solely to update the value of the "idSkCertif" variable.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"setSkcertif>
        <h2>Explain Method - setSkcertif</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a setter method for the `skcertif` variable. The method takes a `String` parameter called `skcertif` and assigns it to the `skcertif` instance variable of the class.<br><br>A setter method is used to set the value of a private variable in a class. In this case, the `setSkcertif` method allows an external caller to set the value of the `skcertif` variable.<br><br>The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object instance. By using `this.skcertif`, we are assigning the value of the `skcertif` parameter to the `skcertif` instance variable.<br><br>This method does not have a return type (`void`), indicating that it does not return any value. It simply updates the value of the `skcertif` variable in the class.<br><br>Overall, this method provides a way to set the value of the `skcertif` variable in the class from an external source.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"isExternal>
        <h2>Explain Method - isExternal</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:** <br><br>This code snippet defines a method called `isExternal()`. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether something is external or not. The method uses a variable called `external` to determine the result. <br><br>The `isExternal()` method is a simple getter method that returns the value of the `external` variable. The return type of the method is `boolean`, which means it will return either `true` or `false`. <br><br>This code can be used in various scenarios where the external/internal state of an object needs to be checked. By calling the `isExternal()` method, you can determine whether the object is external or not. <br><br>It is important to note that the code snippet provided does not include the declaration or initialization of the `external` variable. The `external` variable should be defined and assigned a value before calling the `isExternal()` method.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"getExternal>
        <h2>Explain Method - getExternal</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:** <br><br>This code snippet is a method called `getExternal` which returns a boolean value. The `boolean` data type in Java can have two possible values: `true` or `false`. <br><br>The method simply returns the value of the `external` variable. It is assumed that `external` is a private instance variable within the class that contains this method. The `this` keyword is used to explicitly refer to the current object instance.<br><br>The purpose of this method is to provide access to the value of the `external` variable from outside the class. By making the method `public`, it can be called from other classes.<br><br>This code snippet can be used in scenarios where the value of `external` needs to be retrieved and used by other parts of the code. It provides encapsulation by keeping the variable itself private and only allowing access to its value through this method.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"setExternal>
        <h2>Explain Method - setExternal</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet is a method named `setExternal` that takes a boolean parameter called `external`. The method belongs to a class and is used to set the value of an instance variable called `external`.<br><br>The `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object. In this case, it is used to access the `external` variable of the current object.<br><br>When the method is called with a boolean value, it sets the value of the `external` instance variable to the provided value.<br><br>This method is useful when we want to change the value of the `external` variable of an object from outside of the class. It provides a convenient way to update the value of the variable without directly accessing it.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"getEmpleado>
        <h2>Explain Method - getEmpleado</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code is a getter method for the "empleado" property of an object. The method is named "getEmpleado" and it returns an object of type "Empleado".<br><br>The "Empleado" class is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase. The "this" keyword is used to refer to the current object, indicating that the "empleado" property is a member of the current object.<br><br>By calling this method, we can retrieve the value of the "empleado" property from an instance of the class that contains this method. This allows us to access and use the "empleado" object in other parts of the code.<br><br>This getter method follows the standard naming convention for getter methods, which is to use the prefix "get" followed by the name of the property with the first letter capitalized.</p>
    </section>  <!-- Method Summary Section -->
    <section id="explainmethod"setEmpleado>
        <h2>Explain Method - setEmpleado</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br><br>This code snippet defines a method called `setEmpleado` that takes an `Empleado` object as a parameter. The `setEmpleado` method is used to set the value of the `empleado` instance variable of the class. <br><br>The `this.empleado = empleado;` statement assigns the value of the `empleado` parameter to the `empleado` instance variable. The use of `this` keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.<br><br>This method is typically used in object-oriented programming to encapsulate the process of assigning a value to an instance variable. By using this method, the class can control the assignment process and perform any necessary validation or logic before setting the value.<br><br>In summary, the `setEmpleado` method provides a way to set the value of the `empleado` instance variable of the class by accepting an `Empleado` object as a parameter.</p>

    <section id="explainmethod"toString>
        <h2>Explain Method - toString</h2>
        <p>**Code Summary for Documentation:**<br>This code snippet overrides the `toString()` method of a class. The `toString()` method is a built-in method in Java that returns a string representation of an object. By overriding this method, we can define our own implementation to represent the object as a string.<br><br>In this specific code, the `toString()` method is being overridden for a class called `SkCertif`. The method returns a string that includes the values of different variables of the `SkCertif` object. These variables include `idSkCertif`, `empleado`, `skcertif`, and `external`. The returned string is formatted in a specific way using concatenation and string literals.<br><br>By overriding the `toString()` method, we can provide a human-readable string representation of the `SkCertif` object. This can be useful for logging, debugging, or displaying the object's information in a user interface.</p>
